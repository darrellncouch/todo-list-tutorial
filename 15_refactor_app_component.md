# Refactor App Component

We're going to perform a small refactoring. The app-root shouldnâ€™t have such large template and all this logic. It should just call another component that will deal with that.

* Create a new component called `list-manager`: 

`ng g c list-manager -it`
* Move all the code from `appComponent` to `listManager`
* Call the new component from the `appComponent` template:

```
`
  <todo-list-manager></todo-list-manager>
`
```

That's it! Now we can go on.
